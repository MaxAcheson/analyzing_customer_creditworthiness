# Analyzing Customer Creditworthiness using Logistic Regression Models

This project uses a dataset of historical lending activity from peer-to-peer lending services in order to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. The first logistic regression model uses the original dataset, while the second utilizes a separate set of resampled trainging data. 

## Technologies

This project utilizes python 3.7 along with the following packages:

[numpy](https://numpy.org/)

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 

[pathlib](https://pypi.org/project/pathlib/)

[scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)

[imblearn](https://pypi.org/project/imblearn/)

[jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/)

This project has been constructed in a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook entitled `credit_risk_resampling.ipynb`.

## Installation Guide

1. Make sure you are using python version 3.7 or greater by typing the following:

`python -V`

2. Confirm that the packages are installed by using the following code lines:

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install pathlib`

`pip install scikit-learn`

`pip install imblearn`

`pip install jupyterlab`

## Usage

In order to view the project, navigate to the `credit_risk_resampling.ipynb` notebook in the repository directory. If you cannot find the file, simply click [here](https://github.com/MaxAcheson/module_12_challenge/blob/main/Starter_Code/credit_risk_resampling.ipynb) instead. If you would like to interact with the live version of the analysis, you may navigate to your cloned version of the repository in your terminal and run `jupyter lab`.
